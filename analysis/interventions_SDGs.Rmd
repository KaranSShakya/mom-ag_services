## Dot Plot

Here is the first summary diagram I made. This dot-plot is a summary statistics, which just visually represents the results. I used abbreviated names to make it simpler.

A good way to understand this graph is to focus on the color. 

```{r eval=T, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
source("code/int_2-dot_plot.r")
```
```{r eval=T, echo=F, fig.height=12, fig.width=6}
dot1
```
```{r eval=T, echo=F, fig.height=10, fig.width=6}
dot2
```
