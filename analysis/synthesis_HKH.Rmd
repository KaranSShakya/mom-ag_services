## Summary Statistics 

**1. Summary Statistics by Year**

![](pictures/hkh-summary_year.jpg)

* This table shows how many papers were from the respective years.

* It is important to note that a lot of papers are from **2015**.


**2. Summary Statistics by Country**
```{r eval=T, echo=F}
data.country %>% 
  gt()
```

* Almost one-third of the data are literature from the country: **India** and **China**. This might create a slight bias in the type of key words being used.

## Word Cloud
Word Clouds are interesting and useful visual tool that can be used to highlight key words. What a world cloud does is look into the frequency of key words. If a key word is used a lot, it will be bigger in the diagram. The following picture is a word cloud from both the Author's Key Word and Index Key Word.

It is important to note, that for this word cloud key words with a space will be divided into two. In other words, "agricultural development" will be read as two different key word "agriculture" and "development".

This is a good visual representation to use in informal setting like presentations, but not for academic writing.

## Key Word Frequency - Table
Let's say you want to answer the question **How has the literature framework/priorities changed in the last five years?**

These two tables can help highlight the change.

![](pictures/hkh-keywords_table.png)

There is a lot to unpack from these two tables.

* The **bold** number below is the total number of keywords. Both author and index had more total keywords between 2015-2020 than in papers from 1996-2014. This why I chose to compare the last 5 years.

* In Author, but more clearly in Index, you can see an increase in *climate change*, *food security*, *sustainable development*, *agribusiness*, which does signal an increase in a more holistic approach to conducting research in the HKH (moving from a biological focus to a more socio-economic focus). It is always important to note that these tables do not prove that there is shift in focus, but simply highlights the trends in literature.

## Key Word - Top 50 (Author + Index)
The table below is the top 50 keywords from both author and index. Notice, I have included geographic keywords such as **china**, **himalayas**, **india** etc. In the previous table, I removed these geographic keywords because I did not think it would help with the story. The geographic keywords are often the most repeated, but does not really tell us a lot about the direction of the paper.

This is all the keywords in total. So if China has 53, this means that in all the paper you collected from *1998 to 2020*, China has been the keyword 53 times.

## Combining Author and Index Keywords
**Please read:** I think it is important to understand how I combined the keywords from *Author* and *Index*. This was a really long process and this is important to help understand how the results were made.

Lets take the example of any one paper. The **author keywords** for this paper was "agriculture", "pesticides", and "agribusiness". The **index keywords** for the same paper was "mountain", "agriculture", "pesticides".

As suggested, I combined both these keywords which became "agriculture", "pesticides", "agribusiness", "mountain", "agriculture", "pesticides". Now, a problem with this is that there are repreated keywords. 

So, I then identified repeated keywords and deleted them. So our final keywords for thet paper was "agriculture", "pesticides", "agribusiness", "mountain". Repeated keywords will bias the results as the same keywords will count as two even though it was from the same one paper.

If you do not understand this, please let me know. This is an important part in combining keywords.

I realized that I have yet to show you **R** so here is a sample of the codes I used to do these functions: [Code Link](code_example.html).  

![](pictures/hkh-keywords_5yrs.png)

* This is the 5 years interval picture for both keywords. I will send you the full excel file of these keywords soon, so you can select and reconsider some variables you want to remove or keep.

* Suggestion is to remove keywords such as "agriculture" as these are all encompassing. But I would leave it to you to select the keywords you find effective.

## Trends over Time - Groupped Keywords
```{r eval=T, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
source("code/syn_4-linegraph.R")
```
This is the crude results for the keywords that you groupped.
```{r eval=T, echo=F}
raw
```
This is an **area chart**. Which shows how each attribute contributes to the total over time.
```{r eval=T, echo=F}
geom_area
```

Recommendations:

* I would remove 1995 and 2020. 2020 is not complete, and showing the figures for 2020 does not help.

* The sudden increase in 2015 is simply due to the fact that there are soo many more papers in 2015.

* I would also revise on the keywords. The 5 categories make sense, but the keywords you have selected for each category can be improved upon. For example, keywords like "crop production" is really generic, and can be a keyword in a paper that is entirely about climate change. To see a better trend, and a better graph, I woudl revise the keywords so that each keyword is specific to its category. Another example is "sustainability". This is another generic keyword that can be applicable to not only engagement. The keywords for drivers are good. 

* Let me know if there are any edits to this graph you would like to see. Visually or graphically.
