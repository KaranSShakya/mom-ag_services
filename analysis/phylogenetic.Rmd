## June 24


* Using `ggtree` for a phylogenetic tree turned out to be a tougher task. I am still working on creating a working code, but the following are a few drafts.

* The main issue right now is the colors for each group. This will take a little while to solve.

**Figure 1**
As you suggested, Figure 1 has Order on the outside circle. Since there are not a lot of variations in Order, this figure is smaller.

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
plot(fig1)
```


**Questions**

* Do you still prefer Order or Family as the outside circle?

* Apart from adding the color, do you have any suggestions or changes to the figures?

I could add the labels with the number of count in brackets.

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
plot(fig2)
```
